Any unexpected rendering or lifecycle errors that happen will be\n     caught and cause an error message to be shown in place of the children.\n\n     The error boundary rendering is very very simple by default. A simple message that says there was an error. This\n     is partially because you will always probably want to customize it, and also so there are no dependencies on DOM\n     so that this macro is usable in Native, where there is no DOM.\n\n     You can clear an error with component local state (see example below), but unless the problem has been corrected\n     it will just fail again. Therefore, clearing the error is probably not useful except during development when a hot\n     code reload could actually fix the problem.\n\n     You can also completely take over the error boundary rendering by `binding` or by setting to root binding of *render-error*\n     via `set!` in cljs, and `alter-var-root` in Clojure.\n\n     For example, in cljs you would add something like this in your entry point:\n\n     ```\n     (ns ...\n       (:require\n         [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.react.error-boundaries :as eb]))\n\n     ...\n\n     (defn start []\n       (set! eb/*render-error*\n         (fn [this cause]\n           (dom/div\n             (dom/h2 :.header \\\" Unexpected Error \\\")\n             (dom/p \\\"An error occurred while rendering the user interface. \\\")\n             (dom/p (str cause))\n             (when #?(:clj false :cljs goog.DEBUG)\n               (dom/button {:onClick (fn []\n                                       (comp/set-state! this {:error false\n                                                              :cause nil}))} \\\" Dev Mode: Retry rendering \\\"))))))\n     ```\n     \"\n     [& body]\n     (if (enc/compiling-cljs?)\n       (error-boundary* body)\n       (error-boundary-clj body))))\n"]}
